# Team Name, Phase 1: User Inquiry and Inspection

## Methods

Describe (A) Methods you used (B) Why you used them, and (C) Number of users (e.g. n=10) for each method

## Findings

For each method, describe the users you collected data from (demographics and how they represent your user base) and summarize the findings point-by-point (for example, the distribution of answers for a multiple-choice question). If you are researching existing software and/or competitor software, you may want to include pictures with call-outs that point out both important features and flaws within the interface.

## Conclusions

Discoveries derived from the method(s). For example, explain a requirement (e.g. “Task X needs to be accomplished with fewer steps. . . ”) based on a finding (e.g. “. . . because in our contextual inquiry, we found it was what the users did most often and complained about extraneous work needed to complete it”)

## Caveats

Considerations and/or limitations to the method(s) you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc.

## Personas

Provide each of your user personas, which represent (potential) users of your software; explain how you derived these personas from your user inquiry

## Scenarios

Identify the primary scenarios for your software and for each, include a description that explains who (of your personas) and what they want to do

## Supplementary Materials

Include link(s) or cop(ies) to your instrument(s) itself (questionnaire for a survey, protocol for an interview or contextual inquiry, etc)
