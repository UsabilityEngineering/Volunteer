## Phase 2: User-Centered Design
Jonathan Cheon, Haley Martin, Albert Swingler

This is our homepage where. We wanted to grab the users attention by centering our action calls at the center of the screen. The two options are "GET INVOLVED" and "GET VOLUNTEERS". This phase will focus on the "GET INVOLVED" portion since that is where most users will go to.

Once users click, "GET INVOLVED", they will be shown a new screen where they will be able to get started on our onboarding process. This screen is where they will be able to sign up for an account by providing their name, email, and password.

Instead of asking for the user for a bunch of information at a time, they will be able to provide their information in bits so they don't lose focus.
