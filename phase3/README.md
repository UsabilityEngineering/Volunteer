[Adobe Xd prototype](https://xd.adobe.com/view/5bbd8a21-d7ac-43f2-4fea-d87a30fce811-2d8c/)


Hello and welcome to our user experience evaluation for our project, Resile. We are conducting this study to improve our prototype of our website and would gladly like your response. You will be asked to go through our website to do various tasks while being recorded. Don’t worry, none of your data or recording will be shared to the public. We will keep this record for a short being until our research is over. After each task, we would like your opinion about how you feel, what might you improve, what you did not like, etc. Since this is a prototype, clicking on an area where you might click would autofill with information for you, please disregard the data even if it does not pertain to you. As you partake in this study, we request that you think aloud as you go. This means to say anything that is floating in your mind. Lastly, if at any moment you wish to leave or not partake in our research, feel free to tell us. Any questions before we begin? 

Before - before the person performs the task.   
After - after the person performs the task. 

Task 1: Signup

Homepage
Before: This is our homepage. You are a new user and would like to learn more about the website. Could you tell us what this website does? 

	After: Was there any challenge finding information about Resile? 

Goal: Looking to see if the user could easily find information about the website. We want to see if they can get a hold of what our service does. 

	Clicked signup

Before: Now that you know what this website does, how would you start the process? 

	After: Was there any difficulty finding the signup page? 

Goal: Want to see if the user could easily find a way to get started on the onboarding process. Look for any signs of confusion or distress. 

Background form
Before: Please fill out the following form. 

After: Was typing the following information comfortable for you? What would you do to make it more efficient? How many steps are there in this process? 
	
Goal: Was there too many things to fill out? Did the user feel overwhelmed? Should we replace state/city with just the zip code? Was the user comfortable spelling their language or should we provide a drop down menu? Tick box for past experiences instead? 

Availability form
Before: Please specify what kind of information we are requesting on this page. What step in the process are you in now? 

After: Was it a comfortable process? Does the section scratch your head? If there was one thing you could improve on, what would it be? 

Goal: Did they have an easy time? Would they prefer typing yes/no, tickbox, or dropdown menu? 

Interests form
Before: Please begin

After: Are there any interests you would like to add that were not there? If not, would a “other” section help? 

	Goal: Did they find enough interests? Would an “other” option be a good idea? 

Capabilities form
Before: Could you explain what had happened on this page? 

	Goal: Did they easily notice that the choices they chose matched the ratings? 


2) Make a posting

In this task, you are representing Paradise Alliance Church and you are looking to post an opportunity regarding a Thursday night dinner from 5:00 to 8:00pm. Please begin

Goal: Now that they’re used to the interface, could they post an opportunity on their own efficiently?
