## Phase 3: Usability Evaluation

*Coming soon*


For this final phase, you will prepare and pilot an evaluation of your prototype.

To prepare, first complete your prototype.

The main deliverable for this phase will be a protocol for the usability test. It should include the script and instructions that the moderator will follow as well as fields for data collection. Once you have finalized it, save your protocol in PDF format and added to your repository for phase 3. Similarly to the previous phases, you should create a dedicated section for this deliverable called Phase III: Usability Evaluation.

In the portfolio section for this phase you should include:

A link to the PDF file of your protocol
A link to your complete prototype (here's instructions for XD and Figma)
An explanation of each task and each question in your protocol to describe what you hope to discover from it
An explanation of your overall approach to the study (e.g. formative vs summative, think-aloud, experimental, etc)
In addition, for this phase you will also finalize the project's overall portfolio. Make sure the main page is formatted correctly and published to GitHub Pages. It should include:

the team name, along with a description of the product's purpose,
each team member along with their contributions and link their name to their personal UX Journal), 
Subsection for each of the three deliverables with a executive summary and a link to the dedicated, full deliverable for that phase
